### required other add-ons

This add-on requires add-ons that allow multiple add windows:
 
- for 2.1 you need "Opening the same window multiple time" from
  https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/354407385
- for 2.1 you should also install "Keep model of add cards" from
  https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/424778276
- for 2.0 you  need "Multiple 'Add' and 'Browser' Windows" from
  https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/969743069  


### configuration options:
- `shortcut` (default `ctrl+0`): This shortcut works in the add window, the
  editcurrent window (which you see if you press "e" during reviews), and in the
  browser window.
- `shortcut_copy_note_thats_shown_in_the_reviewer` (default `ctrl+8`): This
  shortcut opens the note that's underlying the current card you see in the
  reviewer to a new add window. 
- `shortcut_side_by_side_from_reviewer` (default `ctrl+9`): this shortcut was
  added for convenience: instead of pressing
  "shortcut_copy_note_thats_shown_in_the_reviewer" and then "e" this shortcut
  performs the two actions with one key press.
- `NoteIdFieldName` (default `Note ID`): If you have used the add-on "Add
  NoteID" in the past and your notes have a field that contains the note id of
  the original note this add-on can replace/update this field if you set
  NoteIdFieldName.
