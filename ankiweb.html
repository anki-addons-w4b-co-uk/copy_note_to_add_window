<b># TLDR</b>
- This description only refers to the version for 2.1. There is an older version for the old Anki 2.0 available under this ID but it offers fewer functions and might contain bugs. Don't use this add-on with the dated Anki 2.0.
- You should adjust the shortcuts before you use the add-on.
- Install the other add-ons this add-on depends on (see "# Requirements" below).
- Use this at your own risk.

<b># Functions</b>
This add-on allows you to copy the contents of the note of the current card to a new Add window when you press a shortcut. You can use this shortcut
- in the Add Window,
- in the window "Edit Current" (which you see if you press "e" during review),
- in the Browser
- during reviews
In the Browser you can also use an entry in the menu or when you are in the upper half over the table you can use the context menu.

<b># Motivation</b>
I regularly notice that some of my cards are too long even though I try to follow the <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/20rules" rel="nofollow">Twenty rules of formulating knowledge</a>. Then I want to split up the note. But if my note contains tags and fields like source, page, etc. this is tedious. Hopefully this add-on helps. I often notice that during review. I could press "e" to open up the underlying note in an Add-like window and then use the shortcut to copy the contents of this window. To make things faster I added a shortcut just for the reviewer that open both windows.

<b># Alternatives</b>
You might not need this add-on: If you only work from the browser you can use the add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1566928056" rel="nofollow">Copy notes</a>. You can open notes from the browser in a full window view with add-ons like <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1996266159" rel="nofollow">External Note Editor for the Browser</a> (in 2019-03 only for the old version 2.0) or my <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1819291495" rel="nofollow">Browser Maximize/Hide Table/Editor</a>. With these you wont' be able to switch the note type and won't have an Add button. 

<b># Requirements</b>
This add-on requires an add-on that allow multiple add windows: <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/354407385" rel="nofollow">Opening the same window multiple time</a>

<b># Bugs, Problems</b>
Bug fixes, improvements or feedback is welcome at my <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__copy_current_note_contents_to_add_window" rel="nofollow">github repo</a>. If you run into problems you can also notify me over there. If you leave a report as a review on this site I can't really answer well.
