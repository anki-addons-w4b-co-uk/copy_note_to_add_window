### Add-on for Anki 

use this at your own risk.

you can download it from [ankiweb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/759018284).

#### known limitations

very recent edits of fields are not copied. You can circumvent this if you press "Tab"
to put the cursor into the next field which saves the current field. Only then trigger
the shortcut of this add-On. 

At some point I will look into this. If you can't live with this don't use this add-on.
Bug fixes are welcome.
